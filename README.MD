# Hello there! 👋

I'm **Steve** from the vibrant city of **Nairobi, Kenya** 🌍, and I'm a software developer with a passionate love for all things computing. 💻

## About Me 🚀

My journey with computers began when I was just ten years old. The moment I witnessed a mouse controlling movements on the screen, I was utterly captivated. As time passed, my passion for computing only intensified.

During my secondary education (2012-2015), I delved into computer studies, which introduced me to the world of programming. It was there that I developed a deep passion for software development.

My enthusiasm for the field led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Technology from 2017 to 2021 at the university. This higher education exposed me to broader concepts. In 2018, amidst the emerging technologies, I fell in love with blockchain.

## My Specializations 💼

### Front-End Development

When it comes to front-end development, I thrive on creating captivating user experiences. I adore using **React**, and recently, I've been delving into the world of **Next.js**. My approach to styling has evolved from Bootstrap to a deep admiration for **Tailwind CSS**. I keep a vigilant eye on the latest tech trends, so if you have a preference for a different tech stack, I'm always eager to adapt. I find hosting with **Vercel** a breeze; it lets me focus on coding, not hosting-related bugs. 🚀

### Back-End Development

In the world of back-end development, I turn to **Node.js** for crafting robust and efficient logic. For data storage, **MongoDB** is my trusted companion.

### Blockchain Development

Blockchain development is another realm where I thrive. I am adept at developing, testing, deploying, and seamlessly integrating smart contracts with front-ends and back-ends. My playground is the **Ethereum EVM**, and I wield **Solidity** for smart contract development. But I'm not one to rest on my laurels; I'm inquisitive and actively exploring other smart contract languages like **Move** and **Rust**. When it comes to development tools, I lean towards **Hardhat** for its remarkable speed and efficiency. 💡

## Beyond Coding 🌿

Outside the world of coding, I'm an avid fan of outdoor activities. You'll often find me swimming, playing badminton, and going for exhilarating rides. I'm not just about tech; I'm also keen on staying updated with the latest in tech news and have a curiosity for global affairs.

## My Promise 🤝

I'm not just a developer; I'm your partner in turning ideas into reality. I'm eager to collaborate on new projects and help clients achieve their dreams! Let's embark on the journey of building something truly amazing together. 🚀
