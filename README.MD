Hey there!

I'm Steve, hailing from the beautiful city of Nairobi, Kenya. 🇰🇪 I'm a software developer with a fervent love for all things computing. 🖥️

A Little About My Journey:
My fascination with computers ignited when I was just ten years old. The moment I saw a mouse making things move on the screen, I was hooked! Fast forward to today, and my passion for computing is stronger than ever.

My Specializations:

Front-End Development:
I enjoy working with React, and I've recently delved into the world of Next.js. When it comes to styling, I've transitioned from Bootstrap to loving Tailwind CSS. I'm always on the lookout for trending tech, so if you prefer a different tech stack, I'm quick to adapt. I find hosting with Vercel a breeze – it lets me focus on coding instead of wrestling with hosting-related bugs. 🚀

Back-End Development:
Node.js is my go-to choice for backend development, and MongoDB is my trusted companion for data storage.

Blockchain Development:
Here's another realm where I thrive! I develop, test, deploy, and seamlessly integrate smart contracts with front-ends and back-ends. My playground is the Ethereum EVM, and I wield Solidity for smart contract development. But I'm not one to rest on my laurels; I'm exploring other smart contract languages like Move and Rust. Oh, and Hardhat has my vote over Truffle for speed and efficiency. 💡

Beyond Coding:
When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll find me outdoors, indulging in activities like swimming, playing badminton, and going for rides. I'm an avid follower of the latest tech news and have a keen interest in global affairs.

My Promise:
I'm not just a developer; I'm your partner in turning ideas into reality. I'm eager to collaborate on new projects and help clients achieve their dreams! Let's build something amazing together. 🚀
