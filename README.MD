# 👋 Hey there!

I'm Steve, a passionate software developer from Nairobi, Kenya. 🇰🇪

## 🚀 About Me

My fascination with computing began at the age of ten, and I've been hooked ever since. I'm a versatile developer, comfortable with both front-end and back-end development, and I have a knack for blockchain development.

## 💼 Specializations

### Front-End Development

I enjoy using React and Next.js for front-end development. Currently, I'm loving Tailwind CSS for styling. I'm adaptable and quick to learn, so I'm open to other tech stacks. My go-to hosting platform is Vercel for hassle-free deployment. 🚀

### Back-End Development

I prefer Node.js for backend logic, and I rely on MongoDB for data storage.

### Blockchain Development

I'm a proficient blockchain developer, capable of developing, testing, deploying, and integrating smart contracts with front-ends and back-ends. I primarily work with the Ethereum EVM and use Solidity for smart contract development. I'm also exploring other smart contract languages like Move and Rust. Hardhat is my choice for development efficiency. 🌟

## 🌿 Beyond Coding

When I'm not coding, I'm all about outdoor activities such as swimming, badminton, and riding. I'm an avid follower of tech news and a curious world observer.

## 🤝 Let's Build Together

I don't just develop; I'm your partner in making dreams come true. I'm eager to collaborate on new projects and help clients achieve their goals. Let's create something amazing! 💡
